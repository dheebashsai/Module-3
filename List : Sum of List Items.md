# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
# Step 1: Define a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Step 2: Calculate the sum using the built-in sum() function
total = sum(numbers)

# Step 3: Print the result
print("The sum of the list elements is:", total)

## Output
The sum of the list elements is: 150


## Result
The program successfully calculates and displays the sum of all elements in the list.
